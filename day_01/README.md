# Day 1

Welcome to your first day of Elm. Today we will be going through the basics of installing the Elm compiler and setting up the rest of your tools.

## Setup

### Installing ELm

The first thing we'll need is the Elm compiler. Head over to [the Elm docs](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html) and select the installer for your computer.

We can verify this is installed properly by opening our command prompt and running

```
> elm --version
```

This guide is built around Elm v0.19.1 and that should be the version you see printed in your command prompt.

### Browser

This guide will be written using [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), however Chrome menus will look very similar. If you're on a Mac and using Safari there will be some differences.

### Code Editor

This guide will be written using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), aka VSCode. Don't feel obligated to use VSCode though. Some other excellent editors include: [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and many more.

If you're using IntelliJ then I recommend installing the [elm plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10268-elm). If you're using another editor then I recommend installing the [elm-lagnuage-server plugin](https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server#editor-support) for your editor. Since I'm using VSCode I will be using the [VSCode elm plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode).
